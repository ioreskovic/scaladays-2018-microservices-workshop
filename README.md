# "Domain-Driven Design and Microservices" at ScalaDays 2018 - Preparation

Please set up your system according to the following instructions before ScalaDays, so you can start coding on Monday right away. The speed of internet access on the workshop is unpredictable, and extensive downloads and setup may cause delays for all participants. Thank you!


To participate in the workshop "Domand-Driven Design and Microservices" at ScalaDays on May 14/15 2018 you'll need:

* A Java 8 JDK. Download / Installation Instructions: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

* The SBT build tool. Installation Instructions: https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html

* A development environment of your choosing. A proven solution is IntelliJ CE - https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ -  with the Scala Plugin (Information: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1347-scala - Download via Settings->Plugins in IntelliJ).

* An HTTP-Client. Either for the command line, e.g. https://httpie.org , or graphical, e.g. https://www.getpostman.com

* The source code that will provide a stub for the application we are going to build. It will be provided here shortly before the workshop, please check back later.


To make sure everything works fine, import the stub project into your development environment. If you can compile it, and apply a simple change and re-compile it, everything will be fine on the workshop as well.


Tip: Even while the sources for the workshop aren't here yet, you can already test your setup with a Lagom "Hello World" project. Just follow the instructions on https://www.lagomframework.com/get-started-scala.html and https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.4.x/scala/IntellijSbt.html



### Option to influence

* The workshop will have a somewhat exploratory, hackathon-like style: We will design an application (or at least a few use cases) using Event Storming, and then implement it using Lagom. I have an idea what we can implement, but you are also welcome to bring your own ideas! If you have a use case you are specifically interested in, we can take a vote at the beginning of the workshop and pick one of the proposals.
